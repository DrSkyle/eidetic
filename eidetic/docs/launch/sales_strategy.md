# Eidetic Sales Strategy

## 1. Product Positioning
**Slogan:** "The Filesystem That Remembers."
**Value Prop:** Eidetic transforms your static file storage into a dynamic, intelligent partner. It organizes your chaos, remembers every version, and secures your secrets—all without leaving your local machine.

## 2. Target Audience
### Primary: Power Users & Developers
- **Pain Point:** Messy downloads folders, lost code snippets, accidental overwrites.
- **Hook:** "Time Travel" (Snapshots) and "Context Bundler" for LLM prompting.
- **Channels:** Hacker News, Reddit (r/rust, r/selfhosted, r/productivity), Twitter/X Tech bubbles.

### Secondary: Privacy Advocates
- **Pain Point:** Cloud storage scanning files, lack of local encryption.
- **Hook:** "The Vault" - transparent local encryption that works with any app.
- **Channels:** PrivacyTools.io, r/privacy.

## 3. Pricing Model
